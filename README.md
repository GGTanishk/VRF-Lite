# VRF-Lite
 This lab was performed to carry out the intent to acquire the ability and the experience to conduct VRF Lite (Virtual Routing and Forwarding Lite). The lab would grant us the ability to successfully deploy VRFs on the nodes, cooperating with different VLANs. During the research, we would come across a term, VRF, and would be able to differentiate between the two terms. virtual routing and forwarding (VRF) is a technology that allows multiple instances of a routing table to co-exist within the same router at the same time. Because the routing instances are independent, the same or overlapping IP addresses can be used without conflicting with each other. Network functionality is improved because network paths can be segmented without requiring multiple routers. VRF also increases network security and can eliminate the need for encryption and authentication.
